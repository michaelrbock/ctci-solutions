##Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

####Problems

1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
2. TODO Implement a function `void reverse(char* str)` in C or C++ which reverses a null terminated string.
3. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
4. Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string with '%20'. TODO: in Java
