####Problems

1. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
2. Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between nodes.
3. TODO
4. TODO
5. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
